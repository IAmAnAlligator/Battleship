## General Information
**Battleship** (also Battleships or Sea Battle) is a guessing game for two players. 
Each player has a 10x10 grid containing several "ships" and objective is to destroy enemy's forces by targetting individual cells on his field. 
The ship occupies one or more cells in the grid. Size and number of ships may differ from version to version. 
In this program I implemented Soviet/Russian version of the game.
